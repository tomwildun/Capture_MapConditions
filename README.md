# README
This script facilitates the update of contracts with specific condition sets based on predefined mappings. It interacts with an external API, fetching contract and condition set data, and updating contracts accordingly.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
The requests library (install via pip install requests)
Valid API credentials and an access token
Setup
Ensure Python and the requests library are installed.
Obtain valid API credentials and an access token.
Replace the auth_token variable with your access token.
Modify the contract_mappings list to match your desired mappings between specific identifiers and condition set names.
Run the script.
Usage
Execute the script to update contracts with the specified condition sets according to the defined mappings in contract_mappings.
The script will display responses from the API, indicating the success or failure of each update operation.
Any contract or condition set specified in the mappings but not found will be added to the failures list, which will be printed at the end of the script execution.
Notes
Ensure that the URLs for the API endpoints (URL and condition_set_URL) are accurate and up-to-date.
Handle any failures listed in the failures list manually, as they may require further investigation or correction of the mappings.
